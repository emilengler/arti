/// It stores it in the data structure and wakes up all the client tasks.
/// (This means there is only one success path for the client task code.)
///
/// There are some wrinkles:
///
/// ### Existence of this as a separate function
///
/// The usual structure for a condition variable loop would be something like this:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// loop {
///    test state and maybe break;
///    cv.wait(guard).await; // consumes guard, unlocking after enqueueing us as a waiter
///    guard = lock();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// However, Rust does not currently understand that the mutex is not
/// actually a captured variable held across an await point,
/// when the variable is consumed before the await, and re-stored afterwards.
/// As a result, the async future becomes erroneously `!Send`:
/// <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/104883>.
/// We want the unstable feature `-Zdrop-tracking`:
/// <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/97331>.
///
/// Instead, to convince the compiler, we must use a scope-based drop of the mutex guard.
/// That means converting the "test state and maybe break" part into a sub-function.
/// That's what this function is.
///
/// It returns `Right` if the loop should be exited, returning the circuit to the caller.
/// It returns `Left` if the loop needs to do a condition variable wait.
///
/// ### We're using a barrier as a condition variable
///
/// We want to be signaled when the task exits.  Indeed, *only* when it exits.
/// This functionality is most conveniently in a `postage::barrier`.
///
/// ### Nested loops
///
/// Sometimes we want to go round again *without* unlocking.
/// Sometimes we must unlock and wait and relock.
///
/// The drop tracking workaround (see above) means we have to do these two
/// in separate scopes.
/// So there are two nested loops: one here, and one in `get_or_launch_connection`.
/// They both use the same backstop rechecks counter.
